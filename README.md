"Andi's Musical Instrument"(?)

This branch contains experimental and personal modifications by Andi McClure. These additions have not yet been released under any open source license. To run these modifications run the "vim" example, i.e. `cargo run --example vim`.

This is a small music program I wrote based on the tui-textarea "vim" code. It is intentionally designed to be used by no one on Earth but me. I have brutally sacrificed any consideration to being easy to use, or even making sense, for any other person. Notes are specified as semitone numbers because I learned music theory wrong. The frontend is vim because I know how to use vim. There is no GUI because I want to run it via ssh on a beagleboard. Some effort has been made to be mostly compatible with "regular" vim. The project is not done yet. [Here is a demonstration of it running](https://sig.grumpybumpers.com/host/amiexample.gif).

## Usage

### Command line

When booting, these arguments are recognized:

`--help` print help (and quit)  
`--play` play song automatically at boot  
`-e` or `--print-error` when an error occurs, print a copy to STDERR  
`-l` or `--loud-syntax` when incorrect language entered, beep  
`filename` Open this filename at boot

### Editing

Enter or load text and then press `^P` to play the current song. (Changes to the song— either for playback, or purposes of showing errors— will not take effect until you enter Normal Mode.) To stop, press `^P` again.

The following `:` commands are currently recognized; some of them are from vanilla vim:

`:q` and `:wq` quit / write-and-quit  
`:new` new empty file
`:w`, `:write`, `:write filename` or `:w filename` save file  
`:e filename` or `:edit filename` open new file  
`:cat filename` or `:!cat filename` insert the contents of the file at the current cursor position (does not change current file)  
`:wv filename` or `:writevisual filename` write the currently selected text to a file (does not change current file)  
`:beep` terminal bell

Like in vim, `:new`, `:q` and `:e` have "force!" variants (like `:e! filename.txt`) which are required if there are unsaved changes.

### The language

#### Notes

Notes may be a positive number or the letter `x` (for a rest). The number corresponds to a number of semitones relative to the base note. Each note will be held for one beat. A note may be preceded by a number of "adjustments" (see below).

The default base note is the 'A' below middle C (220 hz, or MIDI note 69). At the default tempo, one beat is a single quarter-note at 110 BPM.

#### Adjustments

These take "no time" and are executed immediately before the following note. In the following examples, imagine the number `2` may be replaced with any other positive number.

`p22` Set base note absolutely, to [MIDI note](https://audiodev.blog/midi-note-chart/) 22 (a very low B).  
`+2` or `p+2` Increase base note by 2 semitones.  
`-2` or `p-2` Decrease base note by 2 semitones.  
`++2` or `p++2` Increase base note by 2 octaves.
`--2` or `p--2` Decrease base note by 2 octaves.

`t2222` Set tempo absolutely, to 2222 samples per note (this is about 1/20th of a second).
`t++2` Multiply (slow down) the current tempo by a factor of 2.
`t--2` Divide (speed up) the current tempo by a factor of 2.

*"Duty" refers to the percentage of the note which the note is "held down"*
`d2` Set duty to 2 out of 8.
`d+2` Increase duty by 2 (out of 8).
`d-2` Decrease duty by 2 (out of 8).
`d++2` Multiply (lengthen) the duty by a factor of 2 (out of 8).
`d++2` Divide (shorten) the duty by a factor of (out of 8). 
`dv9` "Duty versus"-- change the from "out of 8" to "out of 9" for the values above. (If possible, the current duty will be implicitly adjusted to be "the same".)

`r` Reset all adjustments.

#### Special things

A word preceded by `#` will be treated as a comment and ignored.  
A line preceded by `##` will be treated as a comment and ignored.  
A line preceded by `!` will be treated as "init". `!` lines may only go at the beginning, and may only contain adjustments. `!` adjustments change the "reset state" that `r` returns to.

#### An example

```
! t++2

0 3 7 12
t--2 +1 0 3 7 12 0 3 7 12
r
-1
0 3 7 12
d--2 ## make it choppy
t--2 +1 0 3 7 12 0 3 7 12
```

### Caveats

The program currently assumes it is running at 44100 khz. If your sound card runs at a different rate, unpredictable behavior may occur.  
The program may currently crash.  
Future versions of the program may massively break backward-compatibility with the current version, change names, or suddenly relocate to a different Git URL without warning.

There are several programs similar to this that currently exist in a more complete state. [This one runs in your browser](https://strudel.cc/).

Multi-line text editor can be easily put as part of your TUI application.

**Features:**

- Multi-line text editor widget with basic operations (insert/delete characters, auto scrolling, ...)
- Emacs-like shortcuts (`C-n`/`C-p`/`C-f`/`C-b`, `M-f`/`M-b`, `C-a`/`C-e`, `C-h`/`C-d`, `C-k`, `M-<`/`M->`, ...)
- Undo/Redo
- Line number
- Cursor line highlight
- Search with regular expressions
- Text selection
- Mouse scrolling
- Yank support. Paste text deleted with `C-k`, `C-j`, ...
- Backend agnostic. [crossterm][], [termion][], [termwiz][], and your own backend are all supported
- Multiple textarea widgets in the same screen
- Support both [ratatui][] (the fork by community) and [tui-rs][] (the original)

### Examples for [tui-rs][] support

All above examples use [ratatui][], but some examples provide tui-rs version. Try `tuirs_` prefix. In these cases, you
need to specify features to use tui-rs and `--no-default-features` flag explicitly.

```sh
# tui-rs version of `minimal` example
cargo run --example tuirs_minimal --no-default-features --features=tuirs-crossterm

# tui-rs version of `editor` example
cargo run --example tuirs_editor --no-default-features --features=tuirs-crossterm,search file.txt

# tui-rs version of `termion` example
cargo run --example tuirs_termion --no-default-features --features=tuirs-termion
```

## Installation

Add `tui-textarea` crate to dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`. This enables crossterm backend support by default.

```toml
[dependencies]
ratatui = "*"
tui-textarea = "*"
```

If you need text search with regular expressions, enable `search` feature. It adds [regex crate][regex] as dependency.

```toml
[dependencies]
ratatui = "*"
tui-textarea = { version = "*", features = ["search"] }
```

If you're using ratatui with [termion][] or [termwiz][], enable the `termion` or `termwiz` feature instead of
`crossterm` feature.

```toml
[dependencies]

# For termion
ratatui = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["termion"] }
tui-textarea = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["termion"] }

# For termwiz
ratatui = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["termwiz"] }
tui-textarea = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["termwiz"] }
```

If you're using [tui-rs][] instead of [ratatui][], you need to enable features for using tui-rs crate and to disable
default features. The following table shows feature names corresponding to the dependencies.

|         | crossterm                        | termion         | termwiz   | Your own backend   |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| ratatui | `crossterm` (enabled by default) | `termion`       | `termwiz` | `no-backend`       |
| tui-rs  | `tuirs-crossterm`                | `tuirs-termion` | N/A       | `tuirs-no-backend` |

For example, when you want to use the combination of [tui-rs][] and [crossterm][],

```toml
[dependencies]
tui = "*"
tui-textarea = { version = "*", features = ["tuirs-crossterm"], default-features = false }
```

Note that [ratatui][] support and [tui-rs][] support are exclusive. When you use [tui-rs][] support, you must disable
[ratatui][] support by `default-features = false`.

In addition to above dependencies, you also need to install [crossterm][] or [termion][] or [termwiz][] to initialize
your application and to receive key inputs. Note that the dependency versions of [crossterm][] crate and [termion][]
crate differ between [ratatui][] and [tui-rs][]. Please make sure to use the same version that matches the package you
are using. For example, [tui-rs][] depends on [crossterm][] v0.2.5 or [termion][] v1.5 where both crates are older than
[ratatui][]'s dependencies.

## Minimal Usage

```rust,ignore
use tui_textarea::TextArea;
use crossterm::event::{Event, read};

let mut term = ratatui::Terminal::new(...);

// Create an empty `TextArea` instance which manages the editor state
let mut textarea = TextArea::default();

// Event loop
loop {
    term.draw(|f| {
        // Get `ratatui::layout::Rect` where the editor should be rendered
        let rect = ...;
        // Render the textarea in terminal screen
        f.render_widget(&textarea, rect);
    })?;

    if let Event::Key(key) = read()? {
        // Your own key mapping to break the event loop
        if key.code == KeyCode::Esc {
            break;
        }
        // `TextArea::input` can directly handle key events from backends and update the editor state
        textarea.input(key);
    }
}

// Get text lines as `&[String]`
println!("Lines: {:?}", textarea.lines());
```

`TextArea` is an instance to manage the editor state. By default, it disables line numbers and highlights cursor line
with underline.

`&TextArea` reference implements ratatui's `Widget` trait. Render it on every tick of event loop.

`TextArea::input()` receives inputs from tui backends. The method can take key events from backends such as
`crossterm::event::KeyEvent` or `termion::event::Key` directly if the features are enabled. The method handles default
key mappings as well.

Default key mappings are as follows:

| Mappings                                     | Description                               |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Ctrl+H`, `Backspace`                        | Delete one character before cursor        |
| `Ctrl+D`, `Delete`                           | Delete one character next to cursor       |
| `Ctrl+M`, `Enter`                            | Insert newline                            |
| `Ctrl+K`                                     | Delete from cursor until the end of line  |
| `Ctrl+J`                                     | Delete from cursor until the head of line |
| `Ctrl+W`, `Alt+H`, `Alt+Backspace`           | Delete one word before cursor             |
| `Alt+D`, `Alt+Delete`                        | Delete one word next to cursor            |
| `Ctrl+U`                                     | Undo                                      |
| `Ctrl+R`                                     | Redo                                      |
| `Ctrl+C`, `Copy`                             | Copy selected text                        |
| `Ctrl+X`, `Cut`                              | Cut selected text                         |
| `Ctrl+Y`, `Paste`                            | Paste yanked text                         |
| `Ctrl+F`, `→`                                | Move cursor forward by one character      |
| `Ctrl+B`, `←`                                | Move cursor backward by one character     |
| `Ctrl+P`, `↑`                                | Move cursor up by one line                |
| `Ctrl+N`, `↓`                                | Move cursor down by one line              |
| `Alt+F`, `Ctrl+→`                            | Move cursor forward by word               |
| `Atl+B`, `Ctrl+←`                            | Move cursor backward by word              |
| `Alt+]`, `Alt+P`, `Ctrl+↑`                   | Move cursor up by paragraph               |
| `Alt+[`, `Alt+N`, `Ctrl+↓`                   | Move cursor down by paragraph             |
| `Ctrl+E`, `End`, `Ctrl+Alt+F`, `Ctrl+Alt+→`  | Move cursor to the end of line            |
| `Ctrl+A`, `Home`, `Ctrl+Alt+B`, `Ctrl+Alt+←` | Move cursor to the head of line           |
| `Alt+<`, `Ctrl+Alt+P`, `Ctrl+Alt+↑`          | Move cursor to top of lines               |
| `Alt+>`, `Ctrl+Alt+N`, `Ctrl+Alt+↓`          | Move cursor to bottom of lines            |
| `Ctrl+V`, `PageDown`                         | Scroll down by page                       |
| `Alt+V`, `PageUp`                            | Scroll up by page                         |

Deleting multiple characters at once saves the deleted text to yank buffer. It can be pasted with `Ctrl+Y` later.

If you don't want to use default key mappings, see the 'Advanced Usage' section.

## Basic Usage

### Create `TextArea` instance with text

`TextArea` implements `Default` trait to create an editor instance with an empty text.

```rust,ignore
let mut textarea = TextArea::default();
```

`TextArea::new()` creates an editor instance with text lines passed as `Vec<String>`.

```rust,ignore
let mut lines: Vec<String> = ...;
let mut textarea = TextArea::new(lines);
```

`TextArea` implements `From<impl Iterator<Item=impl Into<String>>>`. `TextArea::from()` can create an editor instance
from any iterators whose elements can be converted to `String`.

```rust,ignore
// Create `TextArea` from from `[&str]`
let mut textarea = TextArea::from([
    "this is first line",
    "this is second line",
    "this is third line",
]);

// Create `TextArea` from `String`
let mut text: String = ...;
let mut textarea = TextArea::from(text.lines());
```

`TextArea` also implements `FromIterator<impl Into<String>>`. `Iterator::collect()` can collect strings as an editor
instance. This allows to create `TextArea` reading lines from file efficiently using `io::BufReader`.

```rust,ignore
let file = fs::File::open(path)?;
let mut textarea: TextArea = io::BufReader::new(file).lines().collect::<io::Result<_>>()?;
```

### Get text contents from `TextArea`

`TextArea::lines()` returns text lines as `&[String]`. It borrows text contents temporarily.

```rust,ignore
let text: String = textarea.lines().join("\n");
```

`TextArea::into_lines()` moves `TextArea` instance into text lines as `Vec<String>`. This can retrieve the text contents
without any copy.

```rust,ignore
let lines: Vec<String> = textarea.into_lines();
```

Note that `TextArea` always contains at least one line. For example, an empty text means one empty line. This is because
any text file must end with newline.

```rust,ignore
let textarea = TextArea::default();
assert_eq!(textarea.into_lines(), [""]);
```

### Show line number

By default, `TextArea` does now show line numbers. To enable, set a style for rendering line numbers by
`TextArea::set_line_number_style()`. For example, the following renders line numbers in dark gray background
color.

```rust,ignore
use ratatui::style::{Style, Color};

let style = Style::default().bg(Color::DarkGray);
textarea.set_line_number_style(style);
```

### Configure cursor line style

By default, `TextArea` renders the line at cursor with underline so that users can easily notice where the current line
is. To change the style of cursor line, use `TextArea::set_cursor_line_style()`. For example, the following styles the
cursor line with bold text.

```rust,ignore
use ratatui::style::{Style, Modifier};

let style = Style::default().add_modifier(Modifier::BOLD);
textarea.set_cursor_line_style(style);
```

To disable cursor line style, set the default style as follows:

```rust,ignore
use ratatui::style::{Style, Modifier};

textarea.set_cursor_line_style(Style::default());
```

### Configure tab width

The default tab width is 4. To change it, use `TextArea::set_tab_length()` method. The following sets 2 to tab width.
Typing tab key inserts 2 spaces.

```rust,ignore
textarea.set_tab_length(2);
```

### Configure max history size

By default, past 50 modifications are stored as edit history. The history is used for undo/redo. To change how many past
edits are remembered, use `TextArea::set_max_histories()` method. The following remembers past 1000 changes.

```rust,ignore
textarea.set_max_histories(1000);
```

Setting 0 disables undo/redo.

```rust,ignore
textarea.set_max_histories(0);
```

### Text search with regular expressions

To search text in textarea, set a regular expression pattern with `TextArea::set_search_pattern()` and move cursor with
`TextArea::search_forward()` for forward search or `TextArea::search_back()` backward search. The regular expression is
handled by [`regex` crate][regex].

Text search wraps around the textarea. When searching forward and no match found until the end of textarea, it searches
the pattern from start of the file.

Matches are highlighted in textarea. The text style to highlight matches can be changed with
`TextArea::set_search_style()`. Setting an empty string to `TextArea::set_search_pattern()` stops the text search.

```rust,ignore
// Start text search matching to "hello" or "hi". This highlights matches in textarea but does not move cursor.
// `regex::Error` is returned on invalid pattern.
textarea.set_search_pattern("(hello|hi)").unwrap();

textarea.search_forward(false); // Move cursor to the next match
textarea.search_back(false);    // Move cursor to the previous match

// Setting empty string stops the search
textarea.set_search_pattern("").unwrap();
```

No UI is provided for text search. You need to provide your own UI to input search query. It is recommended to use
another `TextArea` for search form. To build a single-line input form, see 'Single-line input like `<input>` in HTML' in
'Advanced Usage' section below.

[`editor` example](./examples/editor.rs) implements a text search with search form built on `TextArea`. See the
implementation for working example.

To use text search, `search` feature needs to be enabled in your `Cargo.toml`. It is disabled by default to avoid
depending on `regex` crate until it is necessary.

```toml
tui-textarea = { version = "*", features = ["search"] }
```

## Advanced Usage

### Single-line input like `<input>` in HTML

To use `TextArea` for a single-line input widget like `<input>` in HTML, ignore all key mappings which inserts newline.

```rust,ignore
use crossterm::event::{Event, read};
use tui_textarea::{Input, Key};

let default_text: &str = ...;
let default_text = default_text.replace(&['\n', '\r'], " "); // Ensure no new line is contained
let mut textarea = TextArea::new(vec![default_text]);

// Event loop
loop {
    // ...

    // Using `Input` is not mandatory, but it's useful for pattern match
    // Ignore Ctrl+m and Enter. Otherwise handle keys as usual
    match read()?.into() {
        Input { key: Key::Char('m'), ctrl: true, alt: false }
        | Input { key: Key::Enter, .. } => continue,
        input => {
            textarea.input(key);
        }
    }
}

let text = textarea.into_lines().remove(0); // Get input text
```

See [`single_line` example](./examples/single_line.rs) for working example.

### Define your own key mappings

All editor operations are defined as public methods of `TextArea`. To move cursor, use `tui_textarea::CursorMove` to
notify how to move the cursor.

| Method                                               | Operation                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `textarea.delete_char()`                             | Delete one character before cursor              |
| `textarea.delete_next_char()`                        | Delete one character next to cursor             |
| `textarea.insert_newline()`                          | Insert newline                                  |
| `textarea.delete_line_by_end()`                      | Delete from cursor until the end of line        |
| `textarea.delete_line_by_head()`                     | Delete from cursor until the head of line       |

To define your own key mappings, simply call the above methods in your code instead of `TextArea::input()` method.

See the [`vim` example](./examples/vim.rs) for working example. It implements more Vim-like key modal mappings.

If you don't want to use default key mappings, `TextArea::input_without_shortcuts()` method can be used instead of
`TextArea::input()`. The method only handles very basic operations such as inserting/deleting single characters, tabs,
newlines.

```rust,ignore
match read()?.into() {
    // Handle your own key mappings here
    // ...
    input => textarea.input_without_shortcuts(input),
}
```

### Use your own backend

ratatui and tui-rs allows to make your own backend by implementing [`ratatui::backend::Backend`][ratatui-backend] trait.
tui-textarea supports it as well. Please use `no-backend` feature for [ratatui][] or `tuirs-no-backend` feature for
[tui-rs][]. They avoid adding backend crates (crossterm, termion, or termwiz) since you're using your own backend.

```toml
[dependencies]
# For ratatui
tui-textarea = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["no-backend"] }
# For tui-rs
tui-textarea = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["tuirs-no-backend"] }
```

`tui_textarea::Input` is a type for backend-agnostic key input. What you need to do is converting key event in your own
backend into the `tui_textarea::Input` instance. Then `TextArea::input()` method can handle the input as other backend.

In the following example, let's say `your_backend::KeyDown` is a key event type for your backend and
`your_backend::read_next_key()` returns the next key event.

```rust,ignore
// In your backend implementation

pub enum KeyDown {
    Char(char),
    BS,
    Del,
    Esc,
    // ...
}

// Return tuple of (key, ctrlkey, altkey)
pub fn read_next_key() -> (KeyDown, bool, bool) {
    // ...
}
```

Then you can implement the logic to convert `your_backend::KeyDown` value into `tui_textarea::Input` value.

```rust,ignore
use tui_textarea::{Input, Key};
use your_backend::KeyDown;

fn keydown_to_input(key: KeyDown, ctrl: bool, alt: bool) -> Input {
    match key {
        KeyDown::Char(c) => Input { key: Key::Char(c), ctrl, alt },
        KeyDown::BS => Input { key: Key::Backspace, ctrl, alt },
        KeyDown::Del => Input { key: Key::Delete, ctrl, alt },
        KeyDown::Esc => Input { key: Key::Esc, ctrl, alt },
        // ...
        _ => Input::default(),
    }
}
```

For the keys which are not handled by tui-textarea, `tui_textarea::Input::default()` is available. It returns 'null'
key. An editor will do nothing with the key.

Finally, convert your own backend's key input type into `tui_textarea::Input` and pass it to `TextArea::input()`.

```rust,ignore
let mut textarea = ...;

// Event loop
loop {
    // ...

    let (key, ctrl, alt) = your_backend::read_next_key();
    if key == your_backend::KeyDown::Esc {
        break; // For example, quit your app on pressing Esc
    }
    textarea.input(keydown_to_input(key, ctrl, alt));
}
```

### Put multiple `TextArea` instances in screen

You don't need to do anything special. Create multiple `TextArea` instances and render widgets built from each instances.

The following is an example to put two textarea widgets in application and manage the focus.

```rust,ignore
use tui_textarea::{TextArea, Input, Key};
use crossterm::event::{Event, read};

let editors = &mut [
    TextArea::default(),
    TextArea::default(),
];

let mut focused = 0;

loop {
    term.draw(|f| {
        let rects = ...;

        for (editor, rect) in editors.iter().zip(rects.into_iter()) {
            f.render_widget(editor, rect);
        }
    })?;

    match read()?.into() {
        // Switch focused textarea by Ctrl+S
        Input { key: Key::Char('s'), ctrl: true, .. } => focused = (focused + 1) % 2;
        // Handle input by the focused editor
        input => editors[focused].input(input),
    }
}
```

See [`split` example](./examples/split.rs) and [`editor` example](./examples/editor.rs) for working example.

### Serialization/Deserialization support

This crate optionally supports [serde][] crate by enabling `serde` feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
tui-textarea = { version = "*", features = ["serde"] }
```

Values of the following types can be serialized/deserialized:

- `Key`
- `Input`
- `CursorMove`
- `Scrolling`

Here is an example for deserializing key input from JSON using [serde_json][].

```rust,ignore
use tui_textarea::Input;

let json = r#"
    {
        "key": { "Char": "a" },
        "ctrl": true,
        "alt": false,
        "shift": true
    }
"#;

let input: Input = serde_json::from_str(json).unwrap();
println!("{input:?}");
// Input {
//     key: Key::Char('a'),
//     ctrl: true,
//     alt: false,
//     shift: true,
// }
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version
